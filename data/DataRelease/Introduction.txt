This folder contains simulated fluxes of solar atmopsheric neutrinos accompanying the work:

"Solar Atmospheric Neutrinos and the Sensitivity Floor for Solar Dark Matter Annihilation Searches"
C.A. Argüelles, G. de Wasseige, A. Fedynitch, B.J.P. Jones
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07798


We present a limited simulation release in two folders:
PrePropagation:
 -solar atmospheric neutrino fluxes predicted at each impact parameter for a variety of primary cosmic ray models and for each neutrino flavor.
PostPropagation 
 -solar atmopsheric neutrino fluxes after propagation through the Sun and between Sun and Earth, aggregated over impact factors.

Both folders contain a README with format information, as well as summary plots and scripts with which they were generated, in jupyter notebook format.

Any questions about these fluxes should be directed to the authors:
caad@mit.edu, gdewasse@vub.ac.be, anatoli.fedynitch@desy.de, ben.jones@uta.edu
